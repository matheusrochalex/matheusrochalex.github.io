      <h1>Motion Capture</h1>
      <p>In 2018, I joined the Graphics and Interactive Techniques Research Group (GITRG) and worked on an open-source, affordable motion capture system developed in Python.
        The system was designed to run on a host computer that received the data from cameras attached to a Raspberry Pi 3 each, with each camera detecting markers that were to be attached
        to whatever motion was to be translated as a computer animation.</p>

      <h1>Chev's escape</h1>
      <p>My final project at Western Connecticut State University, a group project with the intent of designing an application using Software Engineering practices.
        The project is a playable game coded strictly in C#, in which the player must go through puzzles in order to obtain the keys to escape the room.
        Group collaborators: Malik Roc, Krishan Singh, Stephen Alpuche, and Cory Pineau.</p>

      <h1>Chromatism</h1>
      <p>A game developed in C# with the Unity Engine for the Game Programming course taught at Western Connecticut State University.
        The game is meant to demonstrate the skills learned in Unity throughout the semester and it demonstrates how the 2D engine can be used to make small minigames.</p>
